# Project-Sonya
Project Sonya is a unique and engaging mobile game that challenges players to take care of a virtual pet with a twist. Instead of directly interacting with the pet, you must listen to your pet's needs and use your skills to meet them.

## Description
In Project Sonya, you are the caretaker of a virtual pet, and the pet communicates its needs through a mechanism. Your task is to interpret these cues and take appropriate actions to ensure your pet's well-being. For instance, if your pet needs medical attention, you must stretch and throw it into the veterinarian's room. If it's hungry, you should guide it to the dining room. When it's bored, you must lead it to the playing room.

## Features
- **Stretch and Release Mechanism**: Utilize Unity Sprint Joint for a unique pet movement system, allowing players to stretch and release their pet to specified locations.

- **Curling Mechanism**: Enable players to reduce friction by tapping on the mobile screen, enhancing control over their virtual pet's movement.

- **Pet Happiness**: Fulfilling the pet's needs and placing it in the correct rooms leads to a happy and satisfied pet, driving the game's success and enjoyment.
